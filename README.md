## Install

Uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to manage monorepo.

**Important:** Do not use `npm ci` or `npm install` directly in the sub-package directories.

### Install all sub-packages

Install the dependencies and build all sub-packages, linking sub-packages together as needed.

```bash
# from top level
npm ci
```

###  Install a sub-package

Install and build a single sub-package.

The script `bootstrap-pkg` installs the dependencies of a given sub-package, building and linking any required internal
sub-packages (by running their `prepare` scripts), and finally the target dependency by using its `prepare` script.

```bash
# from top level
npm run bootstrap-pkg $PACKAGE_NAME
```

Examples:
```bash
# from top level
npm run bootstrap-pkg streamr-client
npm run bootstrap-pkg streamr-network
```

## Build all sub-packages
To build all sub-packages (with dependencies pre-installed beforehand)
```bash
# from top level
npm run build
```

## Regenerate lockfile

```bash
# from top level
npm run clean-lockfiles
```

## Clear caches and built files

The below clears all caches and removes `dist` directories from each sub-package.

```bash
# from top level
npm run clean-dist
```

Alternatively, to just clear caches.

```bash
# from top level
npm run clean-cache
```


## Clean all

This removes all caches, built files, and `node_modules` of each sub-package, and the
top-level `node_modules`.

You will need to run `npm ci`, `npm install`, or `npm run bootstrap`  before proceeding.

```bash
# from top level
npm run clean
```

## Add a dependency into a sub-package

Manually add the entry to the `package.json` of the sub-package and 
run `npm run bootstrap-pkg $PACKAGE_NAME`.

Alternatively:
```bash
npm install some-dependency --workspace=$PACKAGE_NAME
```

## List active versions & symlinks

Check which sub-packages are currently being symlinked.

```bash
# from top level
npm run versions
```

This lists sub-packages & their versions on the left, linked
sub-packages are columns.  If the package on the left links to the package
in the column, it shows a checkmark & the semver range, otherwise it
shows the mismatched semver range and prints a warning at the end.  It
prints the version ranges so you can double-check that they're formatted
as you expect e.g. `^X.Y.Z` vs `X.Y.Z`

## Important changes to the bootstrap/install scripts as of 48e165f:

### Key Changes

* The monorepo is now using `npm workspaces` instead of `lerna`.
* Use `npm@8`, workspaces on `npm@7` are buggy.
* Learn about npm workspaces: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces
* Ensure you know about and understand these npm flags:
  [`--workspaces`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/config#workspaces),
  [`--include-workspace-root`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/config#include-workspace-root)
  and
  [`--workspace`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/config#workspace),
  as well as how they work with [`npm
  install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install#workspace)
  and [`npx`/`npm
  exec`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-exec#workspaces-support).
* `npm ci` will install everything. `npm run bootstrap` is `npm ci`.
* You can now bootstrap individual workspaces like `npm run
  bootstrap-pkg streamr-network`, without running anything else
  beforehand. No `npm ci`, `npm install` or `npm run bootstrap` needed.
  `bootstrap-pkg` installs both top-level and sub-dependencies. This is
  equivalent to what `npm ci && npm run bootstrap-pkg streamr-network`
  used to do.
* To install dependencies into a sub-package you should use `npm install
  --workspace` from the top-level, with the name of the sub-package you
  want to update. e.g. `npm install --workspace=streamr-network`, or
  just regular `npm install` at the top-level to install everything.
  It's possible these two commands will generate different package-lock
  results 🤷 .
* `npm run bootstrap-root` Removes dist/cache & any sub-package
  dependencies from `node_modules`, leaving `package-lock.json` and
  `package.json` alone.  Use when you (only) want to be able to run
  top-level scripts e.g. `npm run versions` without installing anything
  else.
* `npm run eslint` runs `eslint` for all packages. This runs as a
  git push hook.
* `npm run versions` also run `manypkg check`. This lints package.json
  to do things like ensure all packages are using the same versions of
  dependencies. e.g. same version of TS in every package.
