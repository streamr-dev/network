# Background
Streamrâ€™s mission is to replace centralized message brokers with a global, decentralized peer-to-peer network for real-time data. By relying on cryptography instead of trust, the open-source network enables data sharing and monetization in IoT and smart cities, business consortia, individual crowd selling through Data Unions and the Web 3.0.

Founded in 2017, the Streamr project was launched out of the belief that traditional, centralized data infrastructure cannot meet the real-time data sharing needs of future smart cities, business consortia, and an emerging global and massive machine data economy.

The project mission is to build the real-time data infrastructure of the decentralised web (Web 3.0). Streamr technology is a core service layer which implements an open-source and vendor-neutral publish/subscribe (pub-sub) protocol for transmission of any kind of real-time data. The data travels via a global peer-to-peer network which is scalable, robust, permissionless, and secured by a cryptographic ledger. Streamr protocol enables a data economy where humans, AI, and connected machines and applications can share access to data and monetize it openly, fairly, and transparently.
