/**
 * This script overwrites the package.json file inside the dist folder while
 * adjusting relative pathnames for exports. Since the compiled output is inside
 * "dist", but the original package.json references paths as if it's in the root,
 * we need to strip "dist" from all export fields (main, types, â€¦).
 *
 * This ensures that consumers of the package (incl. bundlers like Webpack) import
 * the correct files without referencing "dist" in their paths, maintaining proper
 * module resolution.
