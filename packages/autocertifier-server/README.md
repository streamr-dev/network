# Streamr AutoCertifier

Streamr AutoCertifier is a DynDNS server that upon request by a Streamr node, allocates a random domain name for it and obtains a valid certificate from a public certificate authority that supports the ACME protocol.

## Description

To make it possble for Streamr network nodes running on browsers to join the network, 
as many Streamr Network nodes running on Node.js as possible need to be WebSocket-connectable. Because of mixed-content restrictions on modern browsers, the Streamr Network nodes running a WebSocket server need to have a valid domain name and a certificate.

In order to make the process of setting up a WebSocket-connectable Streamr Network node easier, Streamr Autocertifier provides an automated way of obtaining a domain name and a certificate to those node-runners not willing to register their own domain name and obtain a certificate.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Streamr AutoCertifier needs to be run on a server that
* has a static IP address
* has incoming UDP port 53 open
* has another configurable incoming TCP port open for the REST API
* is configured as the primary DNS server of a domain at a domain provider, with DNS glue records set correctly

To run the Streamr AutoCertifier server, you need the EAB Key ID and EAB HMAC Key that allow Streamr AutoCertifier to open an  ACME account at a public certificate authority. We recommend using the Google Public CA as LetsEncrypt has very low per-domain quotas, and the terms of service of ZeroSSL explicitly forbid our use case. In order to obtain the EAB Key ID and EAB HMAC Key from Google Public CA, follow the tutorial at [https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/public-ca-tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/public-ca-tutorial)

### Installation

* install the autocertifier package
```bash
npm install @streamr/autocertifier
```
* prepare a location for the data directory (eg ~/private/) that is never committed to GitHub for storing the private data of the AutoCertifier

* forward UDP port 53 to the AutoCertifier DNS server port. __Do not run AutoCertifier as root__
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 59832  
```

* set the following environment variables in a .env file in the packages root (values below are non-working examples):

```bash
AUTOCERTIFIER_DOMAIN_NAME="example.com"
AUTOCERTIFIER_OWN_HOSTNAME="ns1"
AUTOCERTIFIER_OWN_IP_ADDRESS="234.134.54.1"
AUTOCERTIFIER_DNS_SERVER_PORT="59832"
AUTOCERTIFIER_REST_SERVER_PORT="59833"

# The directory and the file will be created by AutoCertifier if they do not exist
AUTOCERTIFIER_DATABASE_FILE_PATH="~/private/autocertifier.sqlite"

# The directory and the file will be created by AutoCertifier if they do not exist
AUTOCERTIFIER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="~/private/autocertifier-acme-account-private-key.pem"

# This is the ACME directory URL of the ACME provider.
# The production directory for Google Public CA is https://dv.acme-v02.api.pki.goog/directory

AUTOCERTIFIER_ACME_DIRECTORY_URL=https://dv.acme-v02.test-api.pki.goog/directory

# These are the private EAB keys obtained from the ACME provider, keep them safe!
AUTOCERTIFIER_HMAC_KID="example-kid"
AUTOCERTIFIER_HMAC_KEY="example-key"

# Set this env variable if you wish to replicate all dns records to AWS Route 53
AUTOCERTIFIER_USE_ROUTE53="true"

# AWS access key id, needed if AUTOCERTIFIER_USE_ROUTE53="true"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="example-id"

# AWS access key, needed if AUTOCERTIFIER_USE_ROUTE53="true"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="example-key"

# ID of the AWS region to use, needed if AUTOCERTIFIER_USE_ROUTE53="true"
AUTOCERTIFIER_ROUTE53_REGION="example region"

# ID of the DNS zone in Route 53 AWS, needed if AUTOCERTIFIER_USE_ROUTE53="true"
AUTOCERTIFIER_ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_ID="example-id"
```

* run the autocertifier server
```bash
npm start
```

### Testing

* run usual unit/integration tests
```bash
npm test
```

* run tests that only work on a production server that has the aforementioned prerequisites met and env variables set
```bash
npm run test-production
```

# REST API

This is the REST API for the Streamr AutoCertifier. The API allows you to create and manage subdomains and certificates for use with the Streamr platform.

## Base URL

The base URL for the API is `http://{ip}:{port}`, where `{ip}` is the IP address of the server and `{port}` is the port number.

## Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

### `PATCH /certificates`

Create a new subdomain and certificate.

#### Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object with the following properties:

- `streamrWebSocketPort` (required): The port of your Streamr Node's WebSocket server.

#### Response Body

The response body is a JSON object with the following properties:

- `subdomain`: The name of the new subdomain.
- `token`: The authentication token for managing the new subdomain.
- `certificate`: The certificate for the new subdomain.

### `PATCH /certificates/:subdomain`

Get a new certificate for an existing subdomain.

#### Request Parameters

- `subdomain` (required): The name of the subdomain.

#### Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object with the following properties:

- `streamrWebSocketPort` (required): The port of your Streamr Node's WebSocket server.
- `token` (required): The authentication token for the subdomain.

#### Response Body

The response body is a JSON object with the following properties:

- `subdomain`: The name of the subdomain.
- `certificate`: The new certificate for the subdomain.

### `PUT /certificates/:subdomain/ip`

Update the IP address and port number for an existing subdomain.

#### Request Parameters

- `subdomain` (required): The name of the subdomain.

#### Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object with the following properties:

- `streamrWebSocketPort` (required): The port of your Streamr Node's WebSocket server.
- `token` (required): The authentication token for the subdomain.

#### Response Body

The response body is an empty JSON object.
